                <h2>Strong Passwords:</h2>
                <p>Are essential when making accounts. If you like to repeat passwords, make short passwords, or passwords too easy to crack, you should change them and start making it harder for people to login into your accounts. If this sounds too difficult, you should use a password manager, most are free to use and cheap too, and can be built into some devices like apple.</p>

                <h2>VPNs:</h2>
                <p>Vpns are becoming more well known amongst users and for good reasons. Vpns (virtual private network) are a type of software that protects your privacy and activity. A vpn works by taking any data you are sending over the internet and encrypting it before it leaves your machine. It typically does this using the servers run by the provider of said vpn. These servers are usually in many different locations or regions. The benefit of this is that you can select what region you want and it will mask your location and trick websites and apps about where you are. So not only are you being protected, you can even do things that are region-locked online, such as watching shows available in another country that you couldn’t watch in yours.</p>

                <h2>Avoiding Malware:</h2>
                <p>The best way to avoid corrupt software all alike is by using common sense. Usually, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scams and fraud happen constantly, and sometimes, you may stumble into malware, which will attempt to disable your system. The easiest way to defend yourself from these is to use anti-virus software. Usually, it is standard for most systems to include security measures or anti-viruses built in without cost. Often these will be enough but you are able to buy third-party software if you’d like<a href="http://images.amcnetworks.com/amc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cast_bb_700x1000_mike-ehrmantraut-lg.jpg">.</a></p>

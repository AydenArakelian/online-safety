                    <p>A lot of websites nowadays might track your browsing activity. The reasons for this vary, and although in some cases, it’s designed just to make your browsing experience faster and more convenient, but not always. The data they keep of you can be used to determine browsing habits, preferences, information for other companies like advertisers. These can be a serious issue if you value your privacy.</p>

                    <p>Your browser activity is not as private as you may like to think. Depending on what browser, search engine, wifi you are on and more, you could be watched by someone else. Some websites are also not equipped with a secure connection, which is seen to the left of the url as a lock sign that will display if it is.</p>

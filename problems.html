            <p>A lot of websites nowadays might track your browsing activity. The reasons for this vary, and although in some cases, it’s designed just to make your browsing experience faster and more convenient, but not always. The data they keep of you can be used to determine browsing habits, preferences, information for other companies like advertisers. These can be a serious issue if you value your privacy.</p></li>

Some websites are also not equipped with a secure connection, which is seen to the left of the url as a lock sign that will display if it is.</p></li>
